### 1-Description :page\_facing\_up:

The Bamazon project was one that enabled me to learn more about and utilize the Node.js and MySQL technologies. The design of the application is based around the idea of a storefront. A basic concept of the application is that a user is able to see a list of products for purchase. Once displayed the user is asked if they'd like to buy something and if so, how many units of that item. Input from the user is then used to calculate a total of that order, but refering to the information store in a database. The application also checks to see if there is available stock for the requested item. If it does not, it will tell the user, "Insufficient Quantity!". The quanity information on the database is updated if there is available quantity.

User prompted to view inventory:

### 2-Technologies  :computer:

  This project utilizes the following technologies:


- JavaScript
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### 3-Challenges :scream::boom:

  The challenges that I encountered on this project derived from learning MySQL as a new technology. Being able to communicate with the server to relay information is a very important ability. Understanding basic commands in MySQL will be crucial to overcome challenges with server communication. Another thing to keep in mind when working a project like this one is strings vs. intergers. The destinction between the two will prove useful when working with dollar values.
